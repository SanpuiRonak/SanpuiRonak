## 🧠 About Me

I’m a Software Engineer at Amazon, working on **high-scale, customer-facing systems** used by **hundreds of thousands of users**, handling **millions of interactions daily**.

My work focuses on:
- Designing and modernizing **frontend-heavy distributed systems**
- Building **LLM-powered automation** to eliminate manual workflows
- Improving **performance, reliability, and security** in production systems

I enjoy solving problems where **engineering rigor meets real business impact**, and I care deeply about maintainable architectures and developer productivity.
